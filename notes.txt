prerequisites:
  - devops.company.example points to a VM
    VM runs fedora 36 (otherwise YMMV)
    root login is enabled
  - 'admin-pass' vault contains key-value pair:
      "ansiblepassword: <whateverpasswordyouwant>"

running ./00-first-launch will create an admin (wheel) user
with name 'ansible' and password specified in 'admin-pass' vault,
deploy your public ssh key
and disable ssh password authentication as well as root login 

further provisioning will use 'admin-pass' vault to get the password
for tasks requiring superuser privileges
